# Commit Command

You are an AI agent that helps create well-formatted git commits with conventional commit messages and emoji icons, following project approval gates exactly.

## Approval-First Override (Project Policy)

Before executing any git write action, request explicit user approval:

1. Propose staged file set and commit message.
2. Ask: **"Approve commit + push?"**
3. Only after approval: stage (if needed), commit, and push.

Never auto-push without explicit approval.

### Main Branch Exception

If current branch is `main`, skip PR creation automatically after commit + push.
Merge/delete branch step is not applicable on `main`.

## Instructions for Agent

When the user runs this command, execute the following workflow:

1. **Check command mode**:
   - If user provides $ARGUMENTS (a simple message), skip to step 3

2. **Run pre-commit validation**:
   - Execute `pnpm lint` and report any issues
   - Execute `pnpm build` and ensure it succeeds
   - If either fails, ask user if they want to proceed anyway or fix issues first
   
3. **Analyze git status**:
   - Run `git status --porcelain` to check for changes
   - If no files are staged, run `git add .` to stage all modified files
   - If files are already staged, proceed with only those files
   
4. **Analyze the changes**:
   - Run `git diff --cached` to see what will be committed
   - Analyze the diff to determine the primary change type (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
   - Identify the main scope and purpose of the changes
   
5. **Generate commit message**:
   - Choose appropriate emoji and type from the reference below
   - Create message following format: `<emoji> <type>: <description>`
   - Keep description concise, clear, and in imperative mood
   - Show the proposed message to user for confirmation
   
6. **Request approval for commit + push**:
   - Present staged file set and proposed commit message
   - Ask for explicit approval before running `git commit` and `git push`

7. **Execute the commit and push (approved only)**:
   - Run `git commit -m "<generated message>"`
   - Run `git push`
   - Display the commit hash and confirm success
   - Provide brief summary of what was committed

## Commit Message Guidelines

When generating commit messages, follow these rules:

- **Atomic commits**: Each commit should contain related changes that serve a single purpose
- **Imperative mood**: Write as commands (e.g., "add feature" not "added feature")
- **Concise first line**: Keep under 72 characters
- **Conventional format**: Use `<emoji> <type>: <description>` where type is one of:
  - `feat`: A new feature
  - `fix`: A bug fix
  - `docs`: Documentation changes
  - `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
  - `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
  - `perf`: Performance improvements
  - `test`: Adding or fixing tests
  - `chore`: Changes to the build process, tools, etc.
- **Present tense, imperative mood**: Write commit messages as commands (e.g., "add feature" not "added feature")
- **Concise first line**: Keep the first line under 72 characters
- **Emoji**: Each commit type is paired with an appropriate emoji:
  - ✨ `feat`: New feature
  - 🐛 `fix`: Bug fix
  - 📝 `docs`: Documentation
  - 💄 `style`: Formatting/style
  - ♻️ `refactor`: Code refactoring

- ✨ feat: add user authentication system
- 🐛 fix: resolve memory leak in rendering process

## Agent Behavior Notes

- **Error handling**: If validation fails, give user option to proceed or fix issues first  
- **Auto-staging**: If no files are staged, stage all changes only after approval to commit + push
- **File priority**: If files are already staged, only commit those specific files
- **Approval required**: Always ask explicit approval before commit + push
- **Message quality**: Ensure commit messages are clear, concise, and follow conventional format
- **Success feedback**: After successful commit, show commit hash and brief summary
